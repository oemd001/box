    "Since peers can join and leave at any time, we can't use global [Ring All-Reduce](https://towardsdatascience.com/visual-intuition-on-ring-allreduce-for-distributed-deep-learning-d1f34b4911da) for averaging: a single missing peer can break the entire protocol. Instead, peers dynamically assemble into small groups and run all-reduce within each group. Consider an example with 9 GPUs:\n",
